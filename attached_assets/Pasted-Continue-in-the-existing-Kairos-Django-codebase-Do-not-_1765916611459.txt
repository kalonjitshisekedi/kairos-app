Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild.

Make the following focused content and routing fixes (keep British English and sentence case). Do not stop early.

1) Rename “For enterprise” page and nav label
- The page currently at /for-businesses/ (or the “For enterprise” link) must be renamed in UI to:
  “For organisations”
- Keep the URL the same for now (to avoid breaking links), but update:
  - navbar label
  - page title (H1 and <title>)
  - any internal headings using “For enterprise”

2) Improve “Industries we serve” section on that page
- Expand and refine the industries list to feel enterprise-grade and Africa-relevant.
Include categories like:
  - financial services and fintech
  - healthcare and life sciences
  - energy, mining, and industrials
  - telecommunications and infrastructure
  - public sector and development
  - agriculture and food systems
  - technology and data
  - legal, compliance, and regulation
- Keep the copy concise and premium (no marketing fluff).

3) Remove “Fortune 500” mentions everywhere
- Search the entire repo for:
  “Fortune 500”, “Fortune”, “Private equity” trust bar wording, or any “trusted by Fortune 500” badges.
- Remove those lines or replace with neutral phrasing:
  “Trusted by teams working on high-stakes decisions”
- Ensure the homepage trust line remains clean and credible without specific claims.

4) Remove “Budget range (optional)” from all forms
- Remove that field from the request form UI completely (do not ask for money anywhere).
- If it exists in the model, you may keep it internally but it must not appear on the website.

5) Ensure “Join the expert network” always links to the expert application form
- “Join the expert network” must route to the expert application form page (experts:careers).
- Fix this everywhere:
  - homepage CTA
  - contact page CTA
  - footer links
  - any other references

After implementing, verify:
- /for-businesses/ shows “For organisations”
- industries section updated
- no Fortune 500 mentions remain
- no budget field appears anywhere
- “Join the expert network” goes to the expert application form

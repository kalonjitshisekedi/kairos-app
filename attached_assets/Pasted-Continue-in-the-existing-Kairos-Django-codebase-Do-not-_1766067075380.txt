Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild. Do not revert.

Context:
We stopped during Task 4 (seed_demo). The command runs, but the seeded workflow is not exactly correct.
The requirement is:
- Exactly 1 ClientRequest (status submitted)
- Exactly 2 ExpertMatch linked to THAT SAME request:
  - one proposed
  - one declined
- Exactly 1 Engagement linked to THAT SAME request (and an expert)
- Exactly 3 ProgressEvents linked to THAT SAME request (and/or its engagement)
Currently, the code spreads these objects across multiple requests. We need to fix seed_demo to produce one coherent workflow chain.

Critical rules:
- Do not stop early.
- No TODOs.
- British English and sentence case.
- seed_demo must be idempotent (safe to run multiple times without duplicating data).

Work in these small tasks, in order. After each task, run the command(s) and fix issues before moving on.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 4.1: Inspect current seed_demo logic and define stable identifiers
────────────────────────────────────────
- Open core/management/commands/seed_demo.py
- Identify how it currently creates:
  - ClientRequest(s)
  - ExpertMatch(es)
  - Engagement(s)
  - ProgressEvent(s)
- Decide on stable unique identifiers so objects are idempotent:
  - Use the demo client email to locate the client.
  - Use a single stable “demo request key” such as:
    - title = "Demo request: risk and market entry"
    OR
    - a unique reference field if it exists
- Ensure you can always retrieve the SAME ClientRequest on repeated runs.

Stop once you have a clear plan for a single stable request and stable matches.

Commands to run (no changes yet):
- python manage.py seed_demo

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 4.2: Force seed_demo to create EXACTLY one ClientRequest
────────────────────────────────────────
- Modify seed_demo so it creates or gets ONE request only:
  - status must be submitted
  - linked to demo client user
  - include realistic fields (organisation, brief, engagement_type, etc.)

Important:
- Do not create multiple ClientRequests.
- If one already exists, reuse it (get_or_create).
- If duplicates exist from earlier runs, select one canonical record and do NOT create more.

Commands:
- python manage.py seed_demo
- python manage.py shell -c "from consultations.models import ClientRequest; print(ClientRequest.objects.filter(client__email='client@kairos.co.za').count())"
(adapt import path/model name to actual project)

Stop once the client has exactly 1 canonical ClientRequest (or at least seed_demo always targets one consistent request).

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 4.3: Create EXACTLY two ExpertMatch for the SAME request
────────────────────────────────────────
- Ensure two ExpertMatch rows link to the single ClientRequest:
  - ExpertMatch A: status proposed
  - ExpertMatch B: status declined
- Both must point to different demo experts.
- Use get_or_create with unique constraints:
  - request + expert + status (or request + expert if status updates)
- If a match exists, update its status to required value rather than creating new.

Commands:
- python manage.py seed_demo
- verify counts in shell:
  - number of ExpertMatch for that request is exactly 2
  - statuses are proposed and declined

Stop once that request has exactly two matches, and their statuses are correct.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 4.4: Create EXACTLY one Engagement linked to the SAME request
────────────────────────────────────────
- Create or get one Engagement linked to the request and the “proposed” expert
  (or whichever expert is intended to progress).
- Set status to scheduled or in_progress (whichever exists in your enums).
- Ensure no additional Engagements are created on repeated runs.
- If an Engagement exists but points to the wrong request/expert, update it rather than creating new.

Commands:
- python manage.py seed_demo
- verify in shell:
  - Engagement count for that request is exactly 1

Stop once the request has exactly one Engagement.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 4.5: Create EXACTLY three ProgressEvents linked to the SAME request
────────────────────────────────────────
- Create 3 ProgressEvent entries for the request (and optionally link engagement if your model supports).
- Event types should reflect realistic steps, for example:
  1) request_submitted
  2) experts_proposed
  3) engagement_created
- Ensure these are idempotent:
  - Use a unique tuple like (request, event_type) and update/create.

Commands:
- python manage.py seed_demo
- verify:
  - ProgressEvent count for that request is exactly 3
  - event types match what you defined

Stop once the request has exactly three progress events.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 4.6: Final validation and documentation note
────────────────────────────────────────
- Run:
  - python manage.py seed_demo (twice) and confirm counts do not increase
- Update README demo section if needed to reflect that demo workflow exists.

Final output requirement:
Provide a short summary:
- which models were seeded
- that the single request contains exactly:
  - 2 matches (proposed + declined)
  - 1 engagement
  - 3 progress events
- confirm seed_demo is idempotent

Now proceed task-by-task in order and do not move to the next task until the current one is correct.

Continue from the current state of the existing Kairos Django project. Do not rebuild. Do not revert.

Context:
Replit implemented the 3 homepage CTAs and added “Expert careers” to the navbar.
It also updated most CTA labels site-wide, but it stopped right after noting that two form page titles were intentionally kept as:
- “Submit a request”
- “Apply to join our network”
Then it hit the quota limit before finishing the remaining consistency work.

Your task now is to finish the remaining updates and verify everything works.

Critical rules:
- Do not stop early.
- Do not leave TODOs.
- If anything breaks, fix it and continue.
- British English and sentence case everywhere.
- Keep premium, enterprise-grade wording (not marketplace).

────────────────────────────────────────
1) Update the remaining form page titles
────────────────────────────────────────
Even if they were previously “kept as-is”, we now want consistency.

Find the templates/views for:
A) consultations:submit_request page title and heading
- Replace “Submit a request” with:
  - “Request expert matching”
- Ensure the browser title ({% block title %}) and the on-page H1/H2 heading match.

B) experts careers / join application page title and heading
- Replace “Apply to join our network” (or similar) with:
  - “Join the expert network”
- Ensure the browser title and on-page heading match.

Keep the wording professional and clear. Do not use “apply” in the primary heading.

────────────────────────────────────────
2) Verify all navigation and CTAs are consistent
────────────────────────────────────────
Run a quick search in the codebase for old text and replace where appropriate:
- “Submit a request”
- “Apply to join”
- “Apply to become an expert”
- “Get started” (if it now conflicts with the enterprise tone)

Target consistent labels:
- “Request expert matching”
- “How it works”
- “Join the expert network”
- “Expert careers”
- “Contact us”

Do not change content where “submit” is used inside form helper text describing the action (only headings/buttons/titles should match the new CTA language).

────────────────────────────────────────
3) QA checklist (must be done)
────────────────────────────────────────
- Restart server and click through:
  - Home page (3 CTAs visible and correct)
  - Request expert matching page
  - Expert careers page (/experts/careers/)
  - Blog index
  - Contact us
- Confirm no broken links in navbar or footer.
- Confirm no pages show “Submit a request” or “Apply to join” as a heading/title anymore.

────────────────────────────────────────
4) Documentation update
────────────────────────────────────────
Update README.md if it references old button labels, so it uses:
- “Request expert matching”
- “Join the expert network”
And ensure the click-through checklist matches the current UI text.

────────────────────────────────────────
Final output requirement
────────────────────────────────────────
At the end, provide a short summary:
- Files changed
- Exactly what text was updated
- Confirm the QA checklist passed

Now proceed and complete these remaining tasks.

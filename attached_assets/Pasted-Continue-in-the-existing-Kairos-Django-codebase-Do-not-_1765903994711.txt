Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild anything.

Do not stop early. Do not leave TODOs. If something breaks, fix it and continue until everything works end-to-end. Keep British English and sentence case across the UI.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 1) Fix navbar layout (unauthenticated)
────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: The navbar currently shows “Submit a request” then “Log in” then “Create an account”, which looks wrong.

Goal: Group auth actions together and keep CTAs ordered cleanly.

For unauthenticated users, the right side of the navbar must be ordered as:
1) Log in (nav link)
2) Create an account (btn-outline-light)
3) Submit a request (btn-primary)

Important:
- “Log in” must NOT sit between two buttons.
- There must be ONLY ONE “Submit a request” CTA in the navbar.
  If it exists as a left-side button/link, remove it so it only appears on the right-side CTA group.

After changes:
- Desktop navbar looks balanced and premium.
- Mobile navbar remains readable and not overcrowded.

Task 2) Seed richer demo data (users + projects)
────────────────────────────────────────
Extend or create a management command:
python manage.py seed_demo

It must be safe to run multiple times (idempotent).

Create these demo accounts:

A) Super admin
- Email: admin@kairos.africa
- Password: KairosAdmin123!
- Staff + superuser

B) Operations user (staff only)
- Email: ops@kairos.africa
- Password: KairosOps123!
- Staff = true, superuser = false

C) Client user
- Email: client@kairos.africa
- Password: KairosClient123!
- First name: Morgan
- Last name: Naidoo
- Organisation (if supported): Umkhonto Capital

D) Expert user
- Email: expert@kairos.africa
- Password: KairosExpert123!
- First name: Naledi
- Last name: Mbeki
- Expert profile:
  - Headline: “Former fintech risk lead and emerging markets advisor”
  - Years of experience: 18
  - Sectors/tags: fintech, banking, regulatory, risk
  - Visibility: semi-private (or closest supported value)
  - Verification status: vetted/verified (or closest supported)

Seed demo content:

1) Blog
- Create 3 published blog posts (is_published=True, published_at set) so /blog/ is NOT empty.

2) Demo workflow objects
Create realistic objects so dashboards are not empty:

- 1 submitted client request linked to the client user
- 1 matched/scheduled engagement linked to the client + expert
- 1 ongoing engagement linked to the client + expert (status “ongoing” / “in progress”)
- 1 completed engagement linked to the client + expert (status “completed”)
- (optional) 1 review on the completed engagement, if reviews exist

Important:
- Use the existing models in the codebase (consultations/requests/bookings/engagements).
- If exact status enums differ, map to the nearest equivalent values.
- Ensure these records show up in the correct dashboards.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 3) Update README documentation
────────────────────────────────────────
Add a section titled: “Demo accounts and test data”

Include:
- Commands:
  - python manage.py migrate
  - python manage.py seed_demo
- The demo emails + passwords
- What data gets created (blog posts + requests + engagements)
- A quick click-through test checklist:
  - Home → Blog (should show posts)
  - Home → Why Kairos
  - Home → Contact us (should show contact@kairos.africa)
  - Admin login → /admin/ (manage blog posts)
  - Client login → submit a request (verify flow works)
  - Expert login → expert dashboard (verify it shows assigned engagements)

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 4) Verify and finish
────────────────────────────────────────
- Run migrations if needed.
- Ensure seed_demo runs with no errors.
- Ensure /blog/ shows seeded posts.
- Ensure navbar looks correct and “Log in” is not between two buttons.

Complete all tasks and ensure the app runs without errors.

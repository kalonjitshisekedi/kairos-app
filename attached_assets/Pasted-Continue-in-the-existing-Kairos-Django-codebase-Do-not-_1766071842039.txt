Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild.

Fix: the expert profile edit page is broken for expert accounts:
- URL: /experts/edit/
This page must allow experts to update their profile and upload files (photo, CV, and supporting links).

Critical rules:
- Do not stop early.
- No TODOs.
- Keep British English and sentence case across UI.
- Maintain premium, discreet tone (no marketplace language).
- Ensure file uploads work correctly in development.

Tasks (do in order):

1) Reproduce and diagnose
- Log in as a demo expert user.
- Visit /experts/edit/
- Capture the exact error (404, permission denied, template error, form error, etc.).
- Identify the correct view, url name, template, and form involved.

2) Fix routing and access control
- Ensure /experts/edit/ maps to a valid view and template.
- Access rules:
  - Only authenticated users with expert_status == active/vetted (or user.is_expert) can access.
  - Non-experts should be redirected to home or expert careers page with a message.
- Ensure the edit page loads for the expert demo account.

3) Ensure expert profile model supports required fields
Confirm the expert profile model includes (or add if missing, with migrations):
- headshot / photo (ImageField)
- CV upload (FileField) – PDF/DOCX only
- headline (CharField)
- bio (TextField)
- specialisms/tags (ManyToMany or comma-separated field)
- visibility / privacy level (public/semi-private/private)
- links:
  - LinkedIn URL (optional)
  - ORCID URL (optional)
  - GitHub URL (optional)
- verification status field (read-only to expert)

If adding any new fields:
- Create migrations
- Apply migrations

4) Fix the edit form and template
- Ensure the form uses enctype="multipart/form-data"
- Validate uploads:
  - Photo: image only, safe size limit
  - CV: pdf/docx only, safe size limit
- Show clean help text under each field.
- Add an on-page note in small text:
  “Profiles are reviewed before being shared with clients.”
- Submit button label: “Save changes”
- After save:
  - show success message
  - redirect back to /experts/edit/ (or expert dashboard)
- Display current photo thumbnail if present.

5) Ensure media files work in development
- Confirm settings.py has MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT set.
- Confirm urls.py serves MEDIA_URL in DEBUG mode.
- Confirm uploaded files actually appear when refreshed.

6) Add a regression test
- Add a test that:
  - logs in as expert
  - GET /experts/edit/ returns 200
  - POST with updated fields saves successfully
(For file upload test, you can use a small dummy file object.)

7) Update seed_demo (if needed)
- Ensure the demo expert user has an ExpertProfile created so /experts/edit/ has something to edit.
- Optionally seed placeholder headline/bio/tags.

Finish criteria:
- /experts/edit/ loads for expert accounts
- expert can update profile fields and upload photo + CV
- uploads are stored and retrievable in dev
- tests pass

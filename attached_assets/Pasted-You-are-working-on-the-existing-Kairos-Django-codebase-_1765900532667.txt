You are working on the existing Kairos Django codebase (do not rebuild). Continue implementing new pages and content. Keep British English and sentence case everywhere. Maintain the premium, discreet, enterprise-grade style and the existing colour palette and typography.

Do not stop early. Do not leave TODOs. If anything breaks, fix it and continue until everything works end-to-end.

────────────────────────────────────────
1) Navigation cleanup (reduce CTAs)
────────────────────────────────────────
Goal: reduce navbar clutter and remove “Get in touch”.

In templates/base.html:
- Remove the “Get in touch” navbar button entirely.
- Keep ONE primary CTA: “Submit a request” (btn-primary).
- Keep “Contact us” as a standard nav link (not a button) that goes to the new contact page.
- Keep existing nav links:
  - How it works
  - For enterprise
  - Expert network
Add:
  - Why Kairos (new page)
  - Blog (new page)
  - Contact us (new page)

Ensure the navbar remains premium and not overcrowded on mobile.

────────────────────────────────────────
2) New page: “Why Kairos” (philosophy)
────────────────────────────────────────
Create a new page routed at /why-kairos/ and linked in the navbar as “Why Kairos”.

Requirements:
- Content must explain:
  - The Kairos philosophy (timing, clarity, decisive moments)
  - Why Kairos exists (confidential access to expertise for high-stakes decisions)
  - How Kairos differs from marketplaces (no public pricing, curated matching, discretion)
- Include a “South Africa-based” trust line:
  - Soft positioning: “Based in South Africa, built to surface brilliant minds across the continent.”
  - Do not sound nationalistic; keep it elegant and globally credible.
- Include a section titled (sentence case): “Why this matters in Africa”
  - Soft-launch the concept: “Brilliant minds on the continent are underutilised.”
  - Emphasise global reach: “Built in South Africa, serving organisations globally.”
- End with a single CTA button: “Submit a request”.

Implementation:
- Add Django view + URL route in core app.
- Add template: templates/core/why_kairos.html
- Ensure styling matches the current design system (hero section, dividers, cards, minimal icon use).

────────────────────────────────────────
3) Blog page (simple MVP)
────────────────────────────────────────
Create a blog section with:
- Blog index page: /blog/
- Blog post detail page: /blog/<slug>/

Keep it simple and professional (no comments, no social share buttons in MVP).

Data model:
- Create a new Django app OR add to core: blog
- Model: BlogPost
  - title
  - slug (unique)
  - excerpt
  - content (use TextField; allow basic HTML via safe rendering OR use Markdown and render safely)
  - published_at (datetime, nullable)
  - is_published (boolean)
  - reading_time_minutes (optional auto-calc or manual int)
- Admin should be able to create/edit posts in Django admin.
- Blog index shows only is_published posts ordered by published_at desc.
- Blog detail only accessible if is_published (otherwise 404).

UI requirements:
- Blog index shows 6–12 posts per page with pagination.
- Each card shows: title, excerpt, published date, reading time.
- Blog detail shows: title, metadata line, and content with clean typography.
- Use a calm “insight desk” feel.

Seed data:
- Create 3 sample blog posts about:
  - “Why confidential expertise matters”
  - “The Kairos philosophy”
  - “Building a trusted expert network in Africa”
Write them in British English.

────────────────────────────────────────
4) Contact us page (replace old “Get in touch”)
────────────────────────────────────────
Create a new contact page: /contact/
- Replace any existing contact page if needed, but keep compatibility with current URL names if referenced.

The contact page must include:
- A simple form:
  - full name
  - organisation
  - email
  - message
- Clear privacy note (POPIA-aligned) in sentence case.
- After submission:
  - store inquiry in database (ContactInquiry model if it already exists; reuse it)
  - display a success message (bootstrap alert-success)
  - send an email using Django email backend (console in dev)

Add a visible contact email on the page:
- contact@kairos.africa  (use this as a display email; also include in footer if suitable)

Ensure navbar includes “Contact us” as a nav link (not a CTA button).

────────────────────────────────────────
5) South Africa-based positioning (soft)
────────────────────────────────────────
Update site-wide copy in footer (and optionally homepage) to include one discreet line:
- “Based in South Africa. Serving organisations globally.”

Do not make this dominant. It should read as a credibility signal, not a limitation.

────────────────────────────────────────
6) Dummy users and test data (management command)
────────────────────────────────────────
Create a management command to seed realistic test data so I can log in and click through flows.

Command name:
- python manage.py seed_demo

It must create:
A) Admin user (staff + superuser)
- email: admin@kairos.africa
- password: KairosAdmin123!  (document this clearly)
- first_name: Admin

B) Dummy client user
- email: client@kairos.africa
- password: KairosClient123!
- first_name: Morgan
- last_name: Naidoo
- organisation (if you store it): Umkhonto Capital (or similar professional name)

C) Dummy expert user
- email: expert@kairos.africa
- password: KairosExpert123!
- first_name: Naledi
- last_name: Mbeki
- expert profile with:
  - headline: “Former fintech risk lead and emerging markets advisor”
  - years of experience: 18+
  - sectors: fintech, banking, regulatory, risk
  - visibility: semi-private (or whatever your model supports)
  - verification status: vetted/verified

Also seed:
- 3 blog posts (published)
- 1 sample client request (submitted) linked to dummy client
- (optional) 1 matched engagement object if your models support it, otherwise skip

Ensure the command is idempotent (safe to run multiple times without duplicating).

────────────────────────────────────────
7) Documentation updates (README)
────────────────────────────────────────
Update README.md with a new section: “Demo accounts and test data”
Include:
- seed command instructions
- demo emails + passwords
- what to click to test:
  - home → why kairos → blog → contact us
  - login as admin → django admin → blog posts
  - login as client → submit a request
  - login as expert → expert dashboard (if enabled)

────────────────────────────────────────
Final checks
────────────────────────────────────────
- Run migrations for any new models.
- Ensure navbar links work.
- Ensure blog index and detail pages render.
- Ensure contact form saves and shows success.
- Ensure seed_demo creates all demo data.

Deliver the finished changes in the repo with no broken routes and no unfinished tasks.

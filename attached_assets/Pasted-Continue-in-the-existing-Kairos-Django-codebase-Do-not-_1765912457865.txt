Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild. Do not revert.

Context:
Some changes were not implemented as intended. We need to refine the homepage CTA ordering and restore/improve the enterprise request form so companies can submit a brief and optionally upload a proposal document.

Critical rules:
- Do not stop early.
- Do not leave TODOs.
- British English and sentence case everywhere.
- Premium, confidential, enterprise-first tone (not a marketplace).
- South Africa-based (soft positioning), but globally credible.

────────────────────────────────────────
1) Homepage hero CTA order and labels
────────────────────────────────────────
Requirement:
The homepage hero must show THREE CTAs in this exact order:

1) “How it works” (secondary button)
2) Main request CTA (primary button) – use a shorter, premium label
3) “Join the expert network” (secondary button)

Main request CTA label:
- Replace “Submit a request for an expert” with:
  - “Request matching”
This is shorter, premium, and clear.

Buttons:
- “How it works” → btn-outline-light
- “Request matching” → btn-primary (primary CTA)
- “Join the expert network” → btn-outline-light

Links:
- How it works → core:how_it_works
- Request matching → consultations:submit_request (or the correct enterprise request form route)
- Join the expert network → experts:careers

Ensure the three buttons wrap cleanly on mobile (flex-wrap) and remain in the same order.

Also update any other CTAs on the homepage to use “Request matching” for consistency.

────────────────────────────────────────
2) Rename “Expertise” page label in navbar
────────────────────────────────────────
We want the concept (a non-person, capability overview page) but the label “Expertise” might not be right.

Change the navbar label from “Expertise” to:
- “Capabilities”

Route stays the same (the page remains /expertise/ or equivalent), but the visible label should be “Capabilities”.

Also update any footer link to match the new label.

Acceptance criteria:
- Navbar shows “Capabilities”, not “Expertise”
- Page still exists and looks premium

────────────────────────────────────────
3) Restore and upgrade the enterprise request form (brief + file upload)
────────────────────────────────────────
We lost (or need to extend) the company request submission form.

Requirement:
The request form must capture enterprise brief details and allow optional file upload.

Fields (minimum):
- full name
- organisation
- email
- phone (default +27)
- engagement type (consultation / research / advisory)
- urgency/timeline
- problem description (large textarea)
- optional: budget range (optional, can be blank)
- optional file upload:
  - label: “Upload a brief or proposal (optional)”
  - accepted: PDF, DOCX
  - max size: set a safe limit (e.g., 10MB)
- consent checkbox (POPIA-aligned)

Storage:
- Save submissions to your existing ClientRequest model (or equivalent).
- Save uploaded file on the model (FileField) with proper MEDIA settings.
- Ensure the file is only accessible to staff/admin and the submitting client (if logged in).

UI requirements:
- Premium form layout (card, clear section headings, calm help text).
- Replace any old “submit” phrasing with the new action wording:
  - Page title and H1 should be: “Request matching”
  - Button should be: “Send request”
- After submit:
  - show success message
  - optionally show “We will respond within 24 hours.”

Acceptance criteria:
- The request form exists and works.
- File upload works in dev.
- File field is visible in Django admin.
- Phone placeholder uses +27 example, not +44.

────────────────────────────────────────
4) Update site copy to reflect the form
────────────────────────────────────────
Anywhere you mention the request flow, update copy to match:
- “Request matching”
- “Upload a brief or proposal (optional)”

Update:
- homepage CTA
- how it works page (if it describes steps)
- why kairos page (if it describes engagement process)
- README smoke test checklist

────────────────────────────────────────
5) Final verification
────────────────────────────────────────
- Confirm homepage CTA order is correct.
- Confirm navbar label is “Capabilities”.
- Confirm request form captures all required fields and accepts a file.
- Confirm no broken links.

Proceed and complete all tasks.

Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild. Do not revert.

Context:
Some UI and content changes were partially implemented but issues remain:
- A pound sign (£) is still visible in the UI.
- Expert careers page still says “10+ years of professional experience”.
- Phone number default uses +44 instead of South Africa.
- “Join the expert network” link on the contact form points to the wrong page.
- Expert search page returns nothing / search is broken.
- The homepage and navbar structure feels odd and redundant (“Expert network” + “Expert careers”).
- We want a premium expert network, not an expert marketplace directory.

Critical rules:
- Do not stop early.
- Do not leave TODOs.
- If something breaks, fix it and continue.
- British English, sentence case, premium tone.
- South Africa-first (soft), not UK-centric.
- Do not show individual expert profiles publicly. Do not create “browse experts” behaviour.

────────────────────────────────────────
1) Remove all pound signs and UK currency references
────────────────────────────────────────
- Search entire repo for: “£”, “GBP”, “pound”
- Replace any currency display with South African rand format:
  - “R 1,200” (space after R, comma thousands)
- If currency appears in any seed data or templates, update it.
- Update any tests expecting £ to R.

Acceptance criteria:
- No £ symbol anywhere in the UI or templates or seeded content.

────────────────────────────────────────
2) Remove “10+ years experience” and experience-first language
────────────────────────────────────────
On the expert careers page (and anywhere else):
- Replace “10+ years of professional experience” with skill-first language:
  Examples:
  - “Demonstrable specialist expertise”
  - “Recognised capability in your field”
  - “Evidence of applied work (research, delivery, advisory, leadership)”
- Remove any copy that frames entry primarily by years.
- Keep it inclusive of: STEM PhDs, retired academics, young PhDs, and industry specialists.

Acceptance criteria:
- No “10+ years” requirement appears anywhere.
- The “what we look for” section is skill-first.

────────────────────────────────────────
3) South Africa phone default (+27) instead of +44
────────────────────────────────────────
Locate the contact form / request form phone field:
- Ensure default country code is +27 (South Africa).
- If you are using a placeholder, use:
  - “+27 82 123 4567”
- If you are using a select input or library, set default country to ZA.

Acceptance criteria:
- No +44 default anywhere in forms.
- Placeholders reflect South Africa.

────────────────────────────────────────
4) Fix contact form “Join the expert network” link target
────────────────────────────────────────
On the contact page, any expert CTA must link to:
- /experts/careers/  (experts:careers)

Ensure there are no links pointing to experts:join if that is not the correct page.

Acceptance criteria:
- All expert-joining CTAs go to experts:careers.

────────────────────────────────────────
5) Redesign navigation to remove redundancy and marketplace feel
────────────────────────────────────────
We do NOT want both “Expert network” and “Expert careers” as separate top-level nav items.

New nav structure (top-level):
- Why Kairos
- How it works
- For enterprise
- Expertise (NEW)
- Blog
- Contact us

Remove:
- Expert network
- Expert careers

Replace with:
- Expertise (a new page that shows capability areas, not people)

CTA on navbar (non-admin):
- Primary button: “Request expert matching”

Auth controls:
- Log in link
- Create an account outline button

Admin:
- Primary button becomes “Operations” and no client CTA.

Acceptance criteria:
- Navbar no longer shows “Expert network” or “Expert careers”.
- Navbar includes “Expertise”.

────────────────────────────────────────
6) Create “Expertise” page (not a directory)
────────────────────────────────────────
Create a new page: /expertise/

Purpose:
- Show the breadth of the network without listing individuals.
- Present curated expertise clusters and example engagement types.
- Allow enterprise buyers to understand coverage.

Page sections:
- Hero: “Expertise across critical domains”
- Expertise clusters (cards):
  - e.g., machine learning and data science
  - computational biology and genomics
  - public health and epidemiology
  - fintech and risk
  - climate and energy systems
  - supply chain and operations
  - policy, regulation, and governance
- “How engagements work” mini section
- CTA: “Request expert matching”
- CTA: “Join the expert network” (links to experts:careers)

Implementation:
- Core view + URL + template: templates/core/expertise.html
- Add link in navbar and footer.

Acceptance criteria:
- Expertise page exists, looks premium, and does not show any individual experts.

────────────────────────────────────────
7) Disable or remove public expert search/directory
────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: “Expert page search can’t find anything” and we do not want public browsing anyway.

Tasks:
- Either remove the directory route from public nav entirely, OR gate it behind verified users/admin only.
- If the route remains accessible, it should:
  - show a message: “Access to profiles is available after verification.”
  - not expose individual profiles publicly.

Acceptance criteria:
- No public expert browsing experience.
- Search issues no longer matter publicly because the directory is not public.
- Verified users/admin can still access internal views if needed.

────────────────────────────────────────
8) Homepage CTA labels and structure (tighten)
────────────────────────────────────────
Homepage hero should have three CTAs:
- Primary: “Request expert matching”
- Secondary: “How it works”
- Secondary: “Join the expert network” (go to experts:careers)

Ensure the CTA copy does not mention browsing experts.

Acceptance criteria:
- Homepage hero CTAs correct and consistent.
- No mention of browsing individuals.

────────────────────────────────────────
9) Final QA and documentation
────────────────────────────────────────
- Run search to confirm no “£”, “10+ years”, “+44”.
- Click through:
  - Home
  - Expertise
  - Why Kairos
  - How it works
  - Contact us
  - Blog
- Confirm contact CTA to expert careers is correct.
- Update README if it references old nav items.

Deliver a short summary of files changed and confirm acceptance criteria met.

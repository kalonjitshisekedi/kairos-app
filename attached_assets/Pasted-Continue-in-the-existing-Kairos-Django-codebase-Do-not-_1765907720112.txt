Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild. Keep the premium, enterprise-grade style. British English and sentence case everywhere.

Do not stop early. Do not leave TODOs. If something breaks, fix it and continue until everything works end-to-end.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 1) Landing page: add three CTA buttons
────────────────────────────────────────
On the homepage (templates/core/home.html), update the hero CTA area to include THREE buttons:

A) Primary CTA (btn-primary): replace “Submit a request” with a better label that feels premium and enterprise.
Use this label:
- “Request expert matching”

B) Secondary CTA (btn-outline-light): “How it works”

C) Secondary CTA (btn-outline-light): replace “Apply to join” / “Apply to become an expert” with a better label that feels premium and respectful.
Use this label:
- “Join the expert network”

These CTAs should be arranged:
- Desktop: inline row, primary first, then the two secondary buttons
- Mobile: stacked or wrapped cleanly (no overflow)

Links:
- “Request expert matching” → consultations:submit_request
- “How it works” → core:how_it_works
- “Join the expert network” → experts:careers (NOT experts:join)

Ensure button text is sentence case and matches the new wording consistently across site copy.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 2) Add /experts/careers/ to navbar
────────────────────────────────────────
In templates/base.html navbar links:
- Add a nav link labelled “Expert careers” that routes to /experts/careers/
- Keep it in the main nav area near “Expert network” or under it.

If you currently have:
- “Expert network” linking to experts:join
Keep that, but also include:
- “Expert careers” linking to experts:careers

If the navbar becomes too crowded on smaller screens:
- Keep the link but ensure it collapses nicely (Bootstrap collapse).
- Do not convert it into a CTA button. It should be a normal nav link.

────────────────────────────────────────
Task 3) Consistency pass (copy and buttons)
────────────────────────────────────────
- Replace any remaining homepage hero CTA text that still says “Submit a request” or “Apply to join” so it matches:
  - “Request expert matching”
  - “Join the expert network”
- Ensure you do NOT introduce marketplace wording (no “hire”, “book now”, “browse experts” in the hero).

────────────────────────────────────────
Final verification
────────────────────────────────────────
- Confirm homepage renders with 3 CTAs.
- Confirm /experts/careers/ is reachable from navbar.
- Confirm mobile layout is clean and premium.

Implement all changes now and finish.

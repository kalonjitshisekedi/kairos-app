You are a senior Django engineer and product architect.

You are working on an EXISTING Django SaaS codebase called “kairos”.
Your task is to REFRACTOR the product from a public expert marketplace
into a premium, confidential, enterprise-focused expert network.

IMPORTANT RULES
- Do NOT turn this into a Fiverr-style marketplace.
- Do NOT show hourly rates anywhere.
- Do NOT allow instant self-service booking.
- Do NOT stop early.
- Do NOT leave TODOs.
- If something breaks, fix it and continue until the app works end-to-end.
- Maintain British English and sentence case everywhere.

PRODUCT IDENTITY
- Product name: Kairos
- Tagline: “Don’t guess. Know.”
- Positioning: confidential expert network for enterprise research and advisory

CORE MODEL CHANGE
Kairos is now concierge-led.
Clients submit briefs.
Admins match experts.
Pricing is private and negotiated.

REQUIRED PRODUCT CHANGES

1) PLATFORM POSITIONING
- Replace all “marketplace” language with:
  “expert network”, “concierge matching”, “confidential engagements”
- Homepage hero:
  “Confidential access to vetted expertise.
   Insight when it matters most.”
- Remove any references to:
  hourly rates, instant booking, gig language

2) CLIENT FLOW (PRIMARY)
- Replace direct booking with a “submit a request” flow:
  Fields:
  - name
  - company
  - email
  - problem description
  - preferred engagement type:
    (consultation / research / advisory)
  - timeline urgency
  - confidentiality level
- Request is created as ClientRequest model
- Admin reviews and matches experts manually
- Client never sees pricing until proposal stage

3) EXPERT DIRECTORY & VISIBILITY
- Expert directory visible ONLY to verified clients
- Add expert privacy levels:
  public / semi-private / private
- Expert cards show:
  - headline
  - expertise areas
  - industries
  - years of experience
  - anonymised project examples
- NO pricing fields rendered in templates or serializers

4) EXPERT ONBOARDING
- Rename “Join as expert” messaging to:
  “Join the Kairos expert network”
- Remove academic-first language
- Capture:
  - years of experience
  - senior roles held
  - sector expertise
  - privacy preference
- Expert status:
  applied → vetted → active
- Experts cannot self-publish profiles publicly without approval

5) SERVICE TYPES
Add service_type field to engagements:
- consultation
- research
- advisory

Each has:
- scope
- duration
- internal price (admin only)
- expert payout (expert only)

6) PAYMENTS
- Payments handled at engagement level
- No per-hour pricing
- Stripe remains integrated
- Admin sets price and triggers payment request
- Client pays Kairos
- Kairos pays expert

7) ADMIN / OPERATIONS DASHBOARD
Create or extend internal dashboard:
- queue of client requests
- expert matching tool
- engagement lifecycle management
- expert visibility controls
- featured experts flag
- dispute and notes system

8) POACHING PREVENTION (SOFT)
- Mask emails and phone numbers
- Messaging only inside Kairos
- Session rooms hosted inside Kairos
- Watermark shared files
- Terms reminder banner:
  “Engagements are managed through Kairos for confidentiality and protection”

9) REMOVE / DEPRECATE
- Hourly rate fields
- Public booking calendar
- “Book now” CTAs
Replace with:
- “Request consultation”
- “Submit brief”

10) DOCUMENTATION
Update README.md to reflect:
- concierge-first model
- enterprise positioning
- expert privacy tiers
- engagement types
- how admins operate the platform

FINAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Platform feels premium, discreet, enterprise-grade
- No public pricing anywhere
- Experts are not commoditised
- Clients cannot bypass Kairos easily
- Existing Kairos codebase is refactored, not replaced
- App runs locally and passes migrations

Proceed step by step.
Do not stop until the refactor is complete.

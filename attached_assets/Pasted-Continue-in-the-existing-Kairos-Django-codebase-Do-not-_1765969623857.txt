Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild.

Goal: Implement the core data model and gating logic described in docs/core-workflows/01 and 02:
- Client approval gate before expert access
- Expert approval gate before matching
- Client requests
- Admin shortlist/matching
- Dual-path connection flags
- Progress tracking model (state machine)
- Admin and dashboard readiness (but keep UI changes minimal in this run)

Critical rules:
- Do not stop early.
- No TODOs.
- British English and sentence case.
- No public expert pricing.
- Do not implement payments yet (invoice will be prompt 2).

Step-by-step tasks:

1) Accounts model: add gating flags
- Extend the user/profile model (whichever exists) to include:
  - is_client (if not already)
  - is_expert (if not already)
  - client_status: pending / verified / rejected
  - expert_status: applied / vetted / active / rejected
- Ensure staff/admin can set these statuses in Django admin.
- Add database migrations.

2) Create core workflow models (new app “engagements” or within consultations if preferred)
Create models to support the enterprise workflow:

A) ClientRequest
- client (FK to user)
- organisation_name
- billing_email (optional for now, required later)
- phone (default +27)
- engagement_type (consultation / research / advisory)
- urgency (enum: standard / urgent)
- brief (TextField)
- attachment (FileField, optional; pdf/docx)
- confidentiality_level (enum: standard / restricted)
- status (enum/state machine)
- created_at, updated_at

B) ExpertMatch (shortlist item)
- request (FK)
- expert (FK to user)
- proposed_by (FK to admin user)
- status: proposed / declined / accepted / expired
- note_to_client (optional)
- internal_note (optional)
- created_at, updated_at

C) Engagement (created once an expert accepts or admin confirms)
- request (FK)
- expert (FK)
- status: scheduled / in_progress / awaiting_client_confirmation / completed / archived / cancelled
- scheduled_start (datetime, optional)
- scheduled_end (datetime, optional)
- meeting_mode (enum: platform / admin_facilitated)
- meeting_link (optional)
- shared_notes (TextField optional)
- private_expert_notes (TextField optional)
- created_at, updated_at

D) ProgressEvent (for progress bar + audit)
- request (FK)
- actor (FK to user, nullable)
- event_type (enum)
- message (short text)
- created_at

3) Implement state machine constants
- Centralise statuses in a single module (enums.py) for consistency.
- Add helper methods:
  - ClientRequest.can_view_experts(user)
  - ClientRequest.advance(event_type, actor)
  - Engagement.advance(status, actor)

4) Gate expert visibility
- Do not build an expert directory publicly.
- Ensure any view that returns experts (even shortlist) requires:
  - user.client_status == verified
- Add a decorator or mixin for “verified client required”.
- Add a basic unit test verifying a pending client cannot access expert listing endpoints/views.

5) Update admin interface minimally
- Register new models in Django admin.
- Add list filters for statuses.
- Make it easy for admin to:
  - review requests
  - propose experts
  - mark expert accepted/declined
  - create an engagement record

6) Update seed_demo to include workflow objects
- Extend seed_demo to create:
  - admin + ops + client + 4 experts (diverse: STEM PhD, retired academic, young PhD specialist, industry specialist)
  - ensure client is VERIFIED
  - ensure experts are ACTIVE
  - create:
    - one ClientRequest (status submitted)
    - two ExpertMatch proposals (one accepted, one declined)
    - one Engagement created from accepted match (status scheduled or in_progress)

7) Run migrations and tests
- Create migrations
- Run migrate
- Run pytest
- Fix any failures.

Deliverable for this run:
- New models + migrations
- Admin registration
- Updated seed_demo
- Passing tests
- No payments/invoice logic yet

Proceed and complete all tasks.

You are continuing work on the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild. Do not remove core features. Fix the issues listed below end-to-end.

Critical rules:
- Do not stop early.
- Do not leave TODOs.
- If something breaks, fix it and continue until everything works.
- British English and sentence case everywhere.
- Premium, discreet, enterprise-first tone (not a marketplace).

────────────────────────────────────────
1) Fix logout (blank page issue)
────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: Clicking “Log out” results in a blank page.

Tasks:
- Locate the logout view/URL in accounts (e.g., accounts:logout).
- Ensure logout properly:
  - ends the session
  - redirects to a sensible page (home or login) with a success message
- Confirm the logout URL returns a valid HTTP response (no empty template, no missing redirect).

Implementation notes:
- Prefer Django’s built-in logout() + redirect.
- Add a regression test for logout (pytest) so it cannot break again.

Acceptance criteria:
- Logging out always redirects to home (or login) and the page renders normally.
- No blank screen.

────────────────────────────────────────
2) Admin users should not see “Submit a request” CTA
────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: Admin accounts should not have a CTA to request services.

Tasks:
- Update templates/base.html navbar logic:
  - If user.is_staff (or is_superuser), remove “Submit a request” CTA from navbar.
  - Replace with an Operations CTA:
    - Button: “Operations” (btn-primary) linking to core:admin_dashboard (or equivalent)
  - Keep normal navigation links (Why Kairos, Blog, Contact us) if desired, but no client CTA.

Acceptance criteria:
- Admin sees “Operations” as primary CTA, not “Submit a request”.
- Non-admin users still see “Submit a request”.

────────────────────────────────────────
3) Currency and pricing language: use rand and remove public pricing
────────────────────────────────────────
Requirements:
- Currency should be ZAR (R), not USD.
- Remove any customer-facing language suggesting direct payments in-app for now.
- Payments are business process: invoice / purchase order / bank transfer.

Tasks:
- Search the codebase/templates for:
  - "$", "USD", "dollars", "Stripe checkout", "pay now", "card payment"
- Replace with invoice-led wording:
  - “Invoices and purchase orders supported.”
  - “Payment terms available for approved organisations.”
  - “Engagement pricing is confirmed in your proposal.”
- Ensure no pages show public rates or price tables.

If any model fields or fixtures contain currency:
- Set default currency to “ZAR”.
- Display format: “R 12,000” (use a consistent formatter).

Acceptance criteria:
- All pricing references use rand.
- No Stripe “pay now” flow is implied to clients.
- Any payment pages are either hidden or clearly labelled “invoice only”.

────────────────────────────────────────
4) Update contact email domain
────────────────────────────────────────
Requirement: Use a more conventional domain like .co.za or .com.

Tasks:
- Replace contact@kairos.africa with one of:
  - contact@kairos.co.za  (preferred for South Africa)
  - OR contact@kairos.com if .co.za is not intended
Pick one and apply consistently across:
- contact us page
- footer
- README

Acceptance criteria:
- No old email remains in templates or docs.

────────────────────────────────────────
5) Admin user display name in navbar dropdown
────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: When logged in as admin, the navbar shows generic user name and “Account” behaviour.

Tasks:
- In navbar dropdown label, show:
  - If staff: “Admin” (or “Operations”) rather than first_name.
  - Example: “Admin” with a shield icon.
- Ensure the dropdown includes:
  - Dashboard
  - Operations (for staff)
  - Settings
  - Log out

Acceptance criteria:
- Admin can clearly see they are in admin mode.

────────────────────────────────────────
6) Seed data: expert diversity and Africa positioning
────────────────────────────────────────
Update seed_demo data to reflect a credible expert network.

Requirements:
- Remove anything that strongly emphasises “X years of experience” as the primary value.
- Emphasise specialism, track record, and domain expertise.
- Include multiple expert archetypes:
  1) STEM PhD specialist (e.g., computational biology / ML / materials science)
  2) Retired academic (professor emeritus) with applied advisory experience
  3) Young PhD / early-career specialist with niche expertise and publications
  4) Industry veteran (optional) with senior leadership background

Tasks:
- Update expert seed profiles to include:
  - headline focused on expertise and domain
  - specialisms/tags (STEM, policy, finance, etc.)
  - anonymised project types (e.g., “technical due diligence”, “clinical study design”, “risk model review”)
  - privacy tier settings
- Ensure at least 4 demo experts exist and appear correctly where experts are used internally.

Update “Why Africa” section on the Why Kairos page:
- Focus on the quality of young professionals and research talent produced across the continent.
- Keep it premium and globally credible.
- Avoid “charity” tone.
- Suggested framing:
  - “Africa produces exceptional technical and scientific talent.”
  - “Kairos helps organisations access specialised insight with local context and global standards.”

Acceptance criteria:
- Seed experts are diverse, credible, and not framed as gig workers.
- “Why Africa” copy is confidence-led and premium.

────────────────────────────────────────
7) Payments: invoice-only mode (disable Stripe UI)
────────────────────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Payment is done via invoice/PO processes, not Stripe checkout.

Tasks:
- Hide or disable any Stripe checkout buttons or payment actions in UI.
- Keep payment models (if they exist) but treat them as internal bookkeeping only.
- Update proposal or engagement pages to show:
  - “Payment method: invoice”
  - “Billing contact: …”
  - “PO number: … (optional)”
- Add fields to ClientRequest or Engagement model if needed:
  - billing_email
  - organisation_name
  - po_number (optional)
  - invoice_status (draft/sent/paid)

If adding fields:
- Create migrations.
- Update admin screens.
- Update seed_demo to populate realistic billing fields.

Acceptance criteria:
- No Stripe checkout flows appear anywhere.
- App supports invoice-based workflow.

────────────────────────────────────────
Final verification checklist
────────────────────────────────────────
- Logout works and redirects properly (no blank page)
- Admin navbar shows “Operations” CTA and admin label
- Currency displayed in rand
- Contact email updated everywhere
- Seed_demo creates multiple experts (STEM PhD, retired academic, young PhD specialist)
- Why Kairos “Why Africa” section updated with premium, talent-led messaging
- No “years of experience” is used as the main marketing hook (specialism is)

Proceed with changes, run migrations if needed, update README, and ensure the app works.

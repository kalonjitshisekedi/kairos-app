Continue in the existing Kairos Django codebase. Do not rebuild.

Short task: add a gated “Expert catalogue” browsing experience for logged-in users, and seed 8–10 realistic experts for testing.

Rules:
- Keep premium, enterprise tone.
- No public pricing.
- Catalogue is visible only to:
  - admin + ops (staff)
  - verified clients
- Unverified clients must not see the catalogue.
- Experts can be visible in a discreet, professional way (no marketplace feel).

Tasks (do these in order):

1) Add “Expert catalogue” entry point after login
- Add a button/link in:
  - client dashboard
  - admin/ops dashboard
- Label: “Expert catalogue”
- Route: /experts/catalogue/ (create if missing)

2) Build the catalogue page (gated)
- Create a new view + template:
  - experts:catalogue
  - templates/experts/catalogue.html
- Gate access:
  - allow staff always
  - allow clients only if client_status == verified
  - otherwise show a message and link to the request form
- Display expert cards with:
  - name (or anonymised name if privacy tier is set)
  - headline
  - specialisms/tags
  - short bio snippet
  - verification badge
  - rating (if model supports; otherwise use “Client feedback” label with 4.7/5 style)
- No hourly rates. No pricing. No “book now”.

3) Add “Request matching” action from the catalogue
- Each expert card must have a CTA button:
  - “Request this expert”
- Clicking it should take the user to the request form with the expert pre-selected:
  - Pass expert_id as a query param (?expert_id=123)
- Update the request form to:
  - read expert_id param
  - show “Preferred expert (optional)” prefilled and editable
  - save it on the ClientRequest model (preferred_expert FK) if available; otherwise save as a note.

4) Seed 8–10 demo experts
Update seed_demo to create 8–10 verified/active experts with realistic diversity:
- STEM PhD specialist (ML)
- STEM PhD specialist (biomed)
- young PhD specialist (NLP)
- retired academic (public health)
- industry specialist (fintech risk)
- policy/regulation specialist
- energy/mining specialist
- supply chain/operations specialist
- cybersecurity specialist (optional)
Each must include:
- headline
- bio
- tags/specialisms
- rating (if model supports) or a field your UI can display
- profile photo placeholder (optional)

5) Quick verification
- Run: python manage.py seed_demo
- Log in as:
  - ops user: should see catalogue link and access page
  - verified client: should see catalogue link and access page
  - unverified client (create one quickly): should be blocked
- Confirm “Request this expert” pre-fills the request form.

Finish only when the catalogue is accessible to allowed roles, blocked for others, and seeded experts appear.
